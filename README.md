# Humanfia at IMO 2026 

With the power of [Humanize](https://github.com/PolyArch/humanize), we, the **Humanfia team, have aced all 6/6 IMO 2026 problems** using a *fully agentic, YOLO-style approach*. Every solution has been formally verified by Lean 4.

We build with open source, and build for open source. We release everything including: 
* the [formal Lean 4 statements from AxiomMath](https://github.com/AxiomMath/IMO2026); 
* the final lean solutions ([gpt](./gpt-5.6-solution) and [kimi](./kimi-solution)); 
* the exact GPT and Kimi plans, shared Codex review template, and
  [scripts](./scripts) used to reproduce the solving process.

The project is pinned to **Lean 4.31.0** and **Mathlib v4.31.0**.

## Results

Both the Humanfia(GPT-5.6) and Humanfia(Kimi-K3) workers solved all six problems. The Kimi-k3 run is a
hybrid: a Kimi worker paired with a Codex reviewer, and its numbers below are the combined worker +
reviewer cost. Times are **API time consumption** (time actually spent in model API calls), compared with
the times reported by [AxiomProver](https://github.com/AxiomMath/IMO2026). The fastest reported time for
each problem is bolded.

| Problem | Humanfia (GPT-5.6) | Humanfia (Kimi-k3) | AxiomProver |

| Q1 | ✅ 38.1 min | ✅ 87.1 min | ✅ **24 min** |
| Q2 | ✅ **100.4 min** | ✅ 224.3 min | ✅ 360 min |

## Verification

The formal Lean 4 problem statements under `base/IMO2026` are sourced from
[AxiomMath/IMO2026](https://github.com/AxiomMath/IMO2026). The AXLE verifier
sends an original statement and candidate proof to the configured verification
endpoint and writes a JSON report.

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-imo2026-axle.py \
  --problem imo2026_q1 \
  --original base/IMO2026/Q1/problem.lean \
  --candidate gpt-5.6-solution/IMO2026Q1.lean \
  --output reports/gpt-5.6-q1.json
```

This step requires outbound HTTPS access. The defaults are a 900-second request
timeout and four retries. Exit status `0` means AXLE returned `okay: true`, `1`
means the proof was rejected, and `2` means verification or input handling
failed.


# Quick start

## Prerequisites

- [Humanize](https://github.com/PolyArch/humanize)
- [Elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), which provides Lean and Lake
- Git
- Python 3 for the validation and AXLE scripts
- A C/C++ build toolchain required by Lean dependencies
- Internet access during the first Mathlib setup

## Install Lean 4.31.0

Lean is installed through Elan, the Lean toolchain manager. On Ubuntu or
Debian, first install the system packages needed by Elan and Lean:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl git build-essential
```

On macOS, install the Xcode command-line tools instead:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then install Elan on either platform:

```bash
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
source "$HOME/.elan/env"
```

Verify the installation from this repository. Entering `base` makes Elan
download and select the project's pinned Lean 4.31.0 toolchain automatically:

```bash
(
  cd base
  lean --version
  lake --version
)
```

The Lean version should be `4.31.0`. If `elan`, `lean`, or `lake` is not found,
open a new shell or run `source "$HOME/.elan/env"` again. A global
`elan default` is unnecessary because `base/lean-toolchain` pins the version
for this project. See the [official Lean installation
guide](https://lean-lang.org/install/manual/) for other platforms.

## Install the Mathlib dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
(
  cd base
  lake update
  lake exe cache get
  lake build
)
```

The `lean-toolchain` file makes Elan select Lean 4.31.0 automatically. The
Mathlib cache step avoids compiling all of Mathlib from source.

## Check one solution

Run Lean from the `base` project so it uses the pinned Mathlib environment:

```bash
(cd base && lake env lean ../gpt-5.6-solution/IMO2026Q1.lean)
```

To check the corresponding Kimi solution:

```bash
(cd base && lake env lean ../kimi-solution/IMO2026Q1.lean)
```

Lean normally prints nothing when a file succeeds. A compilation error causes
a non-zero exit status.

## Check every included solution

```bash
cd base

for solution_dir in ../gpt-5.6-solution ../kimi-solution; do
  for solution in "$solution_dir"/*.lean; do
    echo "Checking $solution"
    lake env lean "$solution"
  done
done
```

`lake build` alone does not compile the files in the two solution directories,
so use the explicit `lake env lean` commands above.

## Validate a candidate solution

The local validator checks that a candidate:

- preserves the original definitions, theorem signatures, theorem order, and
  protected docstrings;
- contains none of `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, or `native_decide`;
- retains the required namespace terminator for Q3 and Q4.

It is a structural check, not a replacement for Lean type-checking.

## Validate one file

Run this command from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-imo2026-output.py \
  --problem imo2026_q1 \
  --original base/IMO2026/Q1/problem.lean \
  --candidate gpt-5.6-solution/IMO2026Q1.lean
```

## Validate all included files

```bash
for solution_dir in gpt-5.6-solution kimi-solution; do
  for question in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
    python3 scripts/validate-imo2026-output.py \
      --problem "imo2026_q${question}" \
      --original "base/IMO2026/Q${question}/problem.lean" \
      --candidate "${solution_dir}/IMO2026Q${question}.lean"
  done
done
```

## Work on your own proof

Copy a problem skeleton, replace its proof placeholders, and keep the original
declarations and theorem headers unchanged:

```bash
cp base/IMO2026/Q1/problem.lean /tmp/IMO2026Q1.lean
${EDITOR:-vi} /tmp/IMO2026Q1.lean
```

Then run both local checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-imo2026-output.py \
  --problem imo2026_q1 \
  --original base/IMO2026/Q1/problem.lean \
  --candidate /tmp/IMO2026Q1.lean

(cd base && lake env lean /tmp/IMO2026Q1.lean)
```

Change `q1`, `Q1`, and `IMO2026Q1.lean` consistently for another problem.

## Comparator tooling

`Comparator` and `Landrun` binaries are not included in this repository. If you
already have them, build the bundled `lean4export` source:

```bash
(cd tools/lean4export && lake build)
```

The runners require the resulting executable together with Comparator and
Landrun in the runtime template:

```bash
install -m 0755 tools/lean4export/.lake/build/bin/lean4export \
  /tmp/imo2026-humanize-runtime-v431/checker-tools/lean4export
```

Each experiment creates its own problem-specific Comparator challenge and
configuration inside the isolated workspace, then invokes
`scripts/check-with-comparator.sh`.

## Reproduce the model experiments

The experiment harness is separate from ordinary proof checking. It was built
for a pre-provisioned Linux environment and is **not** a portable one-command
runner for macOS or a fresh Linux installation.

### Compact GPT-5.6 entrypoint

Run one question through the GPT-5.6 worker/reviewer pipeline with the exact
checked-in experiment plan:

```bash
bash scripts/run-imo2026-gpt-5-6.sh \
  --prompt gpt_plan.md \
  --question problem/2026-q1.lean
```

The question name selects Q1 through Q6. If the named path does not exist, the
entrypoint uses the corresponding canonical statement under `base/IMO2026`.
An existing question file is used directly and snapshotted into the isolated
workspace. `gpt_plan.md` is the parameterized form of the active plan embedded
in the successful experiment shell. The runner renders its problem, module,
model, and turn-limit placeholders before starting the loop. The shared Codex
review prompt is `regular-review.md`.

Validate the interface and prerequisites without creating a run:

```bash
bash scripts/run-imo2026-gpt-5-6.sh \
  --prompt gpt_plan.md \
  --question base/IMO2026/Q1/problem.lean \
  --dry-run
```

Additional options such as `--run-id`, `--out-root`, `--max-turns`,
`--prepare-only`, and the recovery modes are forwarded to the internal
`scripts/run-imo2026.sh` engine.

### Compact Kimi-K3 entrypoint

Run one question using Kimi K3 as the worker, Codex as the reviewer, and the
exact checked-in Kimi experiment plan:

```bash
bash scripts/run-imo2026-kimi-k3.sh \
  --prompt kimi_plan.md \
  --question problem/2026-q1.lean
```

The compact entrypoint has the same question-path behavior as the GPT-5.6
entrypoint. `kimi_plan.md` is rendered with the selected problem, module, model,
reviewer, and turn-limit values. Additional runner options are forwarded to
the native Kimi-worker/Codex-reviewer engine in
`scripts/run-imo2026-kimi.sh`.

The repository does not require an `inputs/` directory. The compact entrypoints
select one problem from `--question`; the full engines default internally to
Q1–Q6. `--problem` can select one or more explicit IDs, and `--failure-file`
remains available as an optional override.

The harness expects:

- Linux utilities including `proot`, `setpriv`, `getent`, `flock`, `jq`, `rg`,
  a C compiler, and GNU `timeout`;
- a working Codex binary and Codex configuration/authentication directory;
- for Kimi runs, native Kimi Code with a configured K3 alias and thinking
  enabled;
- a populated `base/.lake/packages` Mathlib checkout;
- an external Comparator binary and Landrun binary;
- a runtime template containing Lean, Mathlib, Comparator, Landrun, and
  `lean4export`;
- `/mathlib-packages` linked to the pinned package cache;
- isolated users named `humanize-imo-q1` through `humanize-imo-q6`, unless
  `HUMANIZE_USER_PREFIX` is changed.

The default runtime template layout is:

```text
/tmp/imo2026-humanize-runtime-v431/
├── root/.elan/bin/lake
├── mathlib-packages/mathlib/
├── checker-tools/lean4export
└── comparator-tools/
    ├── comparator
    └── landrun
```

The checked-in scripts do not have executable file modes, while the harness
requires its Comparator wrapper to be executable. Prepare them once with:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/*.py
```

### Worker network isolation

The files `scripts/nonet-preload.c` and `scripts/nonet-shell.c` are intentionally
kept as runtime dependencies. At the start of a run, each engine compiles
`nonet-preload.c` into an `LD_PRELOAD` library that rejects socket creation and
connection/bind operations with `EACCES`. It compiles `nonet-shell.c` into the
worker shell that installs that preload library before executing the real
shell. This supplements the runner-generated seccomp socket-denial wrapper and
keeps worker shell commands offline; reviewers retain only the network access
required for AXLE verification.

## GPT-5.6 run

After provisioning the environment, run one problem first:

```bash
BASE_CODEX_HOME=/path/to/codex-home \
CODEX_BIN=/path/to/codex \
LOCAL_RUNTIME_TEMPLATE=/tmp/imo2026-humanize-runtime-v431 \
bash scripts/run-imo2026.sh \
  --problem imo2026_q1 \
  --jobs 1 \
  --fallback-jobs 1 \
  --probe-count 1
```

This runner is fixed to the `gpt-5.6-sol` model and rejects another
`CODEX_MODEL` value.

## Kimi run

### Install native Kimi Code

Install the native `kimi` command on Linux or macOS with the official
installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh | bash
kimi --version
kimi login
```

Kimi Code stores its configuration, credentials, and sessions under
`${KIMI_CODE_HOME:-$HOME/.kimi-code}`. Do not commit that directory. The native
worker shell requires the resolved binary path and a readable configured home:

```bash
export BASE_KIMI_HOME="${KIMI_CODE_HOME:-$HOME/.kimi-code}"
export KIMI_BIN="$(readlink -f "$(command -v kimi)")"
test -s "$BASE_KIMI_HOME/config.toml"
```

See the [official Kimi Code installation
guide](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/guides/getting-started.html)
for Windows, npm, upgrade, and login instructions. The Kimi configuration must
define the `kimi-for-coding/k3` alias with model ID `k3` and thinking enabled.

Run one problem first. Native Kimi performs the proof work and Codex performs
the isolated AXLE-backed review:

```bash
BASE_KIMI_HOME=/path/to/kimi-code-home \
BASE_CODEX_HOME=/path/to/codex-home \
KIMI_BIN=/absolute/path/to/kimi \
LOCAL_RUNTIME_TEMPLATE=/tmp/imo2026-humanize-runtime-v431 \
bash scripts/run-imo2026-kimi.sh \
  --problem imo2026_q1 \
  --jobs 1 \
  --fallback-jobs 1 \
  --probe-count 1
```

The Kimi worker model is fixed to `kimi-for-coding/k3`. The reviewer defaults
to Codex model `gpt-5.5` with `xhigh` reasoning effort.

Use `bash scripts/run-imo2026.sh --help` for the GPT options and
`bash scripts/run-imo2026-kimi.sh --help` for the Kimi-worker/Codex-reviewer
options.

Useful options include:

- `--problem imo2026_qN` — select a problem; repeat to select several;
- `--max-turns N` — set the worker/reviewer turn limit;
- `--prepare-only` — create and audit isolated workspaces without starting a
  model;
- `--resume-prepared`, `--resume-worker-only`, and `--resume-review-only` —
  continue an existing run;
- `--run-id ID` and `--out-root PATH` — control result locations.

Even `--dry-run` performs the harness prerequisite checks.

## Recover an interrupted experiment

Recovery must reuse the original `RUN_ID`, `OUT_ROOT`, `LOCAL_RUNS_ROOT`,
`LOCAL_RUNTIME_TEMPLATE`, and credential locations. Preserve both
`$OUT_ROOT/$RUN_ID`, which contains job state and provenance, and
`$LOCAL_RUNS_ROOT/$RUN_ID`, which contains the real workspaces and per-job model
homes. The `workspaces` and `agent-homes` entries in the output directory are
symlinks into that local run tree; keeping only the output directory is not
enough to resume.

Restore the original environment and inspect each job's state before choosing
a recovery mode:

```bash
export RUN_ID=the-original-run-id
export OUT_ROOT=/path/to/original/output-root
export LOCAL_RUNS_ROOT=/path/to/original/local-runs-root
export LOCAL_RUNTIME_TEMPLATE=/path/to/imo2026-humanize-runtime-v431

find "$OUT_ROOT/$RUN_ID/jobs" -name status.txt -print -exec cat {} \;
```

Use `--resume-prepared` only for jobs in `prepared` or `pending` state:

```bash
bash scripts/run-imo2026.sh --run-id "$RUN_ID" --resume-prepared
```

Worker-only and reviewer-only recovery each require exactly one selected
problem. They preserve the prepared workspace and continue the recorded round:

```bash
bash scripts/run-imo2026.sh --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  --problem imo2026_q1 --resume-worker-only

bash scripts/run-imo2026.sh --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  --problem imo2026_q1 --resume-review-only
```

For a Kimi-worker/Codex-reviewer run, use the same environment and replace
`run-imo2026.sh` with `run-imo2026-kimi.sh`. Also restore the original
`BASE_KIMI_HOME`, `BASE_CODEX_HOME`, and `KIMI_BIN`.
Do not start a new run, delete either preserved run tree, or copy a candidate
into a fresh workspace as a substitute for recovery.

## Experiment outputs

Runs are written under `runs/<RUN_ID>/`. Important artifacts include:

- `RUN.md` — run configuration and provenance;
- `jobs/` — per-problem status, hashes, and local-check logs;
- `metrics.tsv` — final per-job status and timing;
- `codex-sessions.tsv` — GPT worker/reviewer sessions or Kimi-run Codex
  reviewer sessions;
- `kimi-sessions.tsv` — Kimi worker sessions for hybrid runs;
- `workspaces` and `agent-homes` — links to the isolated runtime directories;
- rate-limit and transport-failure logs when those conditions occur.

Workers have network access blocked. Reviewers receive network access only for
the prompted AXLE verification step. Existing solution directories are not
mounted into either model namespace.
